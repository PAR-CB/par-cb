## Hello World! 💫
I am Pablo Álvarez Rodríguez, PARCB.
I am currently working as a Scientific Services Technician and I am learning a whole lot of programming and coding, mostly in Python and R.
I have worked with MATLAB and LaTeX too.
This is my personal repository, maybe there would be new things here... 😁
